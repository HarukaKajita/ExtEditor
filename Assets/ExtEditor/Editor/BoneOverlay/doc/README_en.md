## Advanced Usage

### Utilizing Distance Filtering

In large scenes, adjust distance filtering to show only necessary bones:

- Set shorter distances for detailed close-up work
- Set longer distances for overview perspectives
- Configure separate distances for labels and bones

### Color Customization

Customize colors based on your work context for improved visibility:

- Use brighter colors in dark scenes
- Use vibrant colors to highlight specific bones
- Adjust transparency as needed

### Performance Optimization

When working with many bones:

- Set minimum necessary distance
- Turn off label display for lighter operation
- Focus only on working area

## Troubleshooting

### Bones Not Displaying

1. Check if "Bones" toggle is enabled in Scene View
2. Verify distance settings are appropriate (default: 50m)
3. Confirm objects have SkinnedMeshRenderer or Animator components

### Cannot Select

1. Check if bones are not locked
2. Verify no other tools are interfering
3. Ensure Scene View is in appropriate mode

### Performance Issues

1. Reduce display distance
2. Turn off label display
3. Hide unnecessary objects
